# Monkey Lang

Monkey Lang is a programming language based on books writted by Thorsten Ball: **[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)** and **[Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/)**. I wanted to learn more about programming language creation and the go programming language, and the premise of these books perfectly fit what I was looking for.
